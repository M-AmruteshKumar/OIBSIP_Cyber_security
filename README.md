# OIBSIP_Cyber_security
# 🔐 Network Security Project Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio — a collection of practical assessments and research reports focused on identifying, analyzing, and documenting network and system vulnerabilities.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Nikto** – Web vulnerability scanner
- **Nmap** – Port scanning and host discovery
- **PowerShell & curl** – Command-line host interrogation
- **Microsoft Word** – Technical documentation

## 📊 Project Reports

### 1. 🔍 **Nikto Web Server Scan**
- Attempted vulnerability scan on `192.168.0.108` using Nikto v2.5.0
- Learned diagnostic techniques (debug flags, connection handling)
- Analyzed issues like `Error 10061` — "target actively refused connection"

### 2. 🌐 **Nmap TCP Port Scan**
- Scanned 192.168.1.114 with 65,535 ports
- Discovered 14 open/filtered ports including SMB (445), NetBIOS (139), RPC (135), and unknown high ports
- Interpreted scan results, possible vulnerabilities, and suggestions
